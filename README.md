Conservation Data

This is a repository of colorimetric and condition reporting information for the special collections of [Mannix Library](https://mannix.org.au)

The Jupyter Notebooks were created in Colaboratory using the Albedo app for reflectance readings and the built in Colorimeter from an iPhone 11 Pro Max.

Calibrations were done with an X-Rite ColourChecker Passport.
